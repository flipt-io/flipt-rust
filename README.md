# Flipt Rust Library

## Documentation

API documentation is available at <https://www.flipt.io/docs/reference/overview>.

## Beta status

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning the package version to a specific version in your Cargo.toml file. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally looking for the latest version.
